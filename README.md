# Libft - 42
Libft project from the 42 cursus.

This project entails creating a library of 40+ functions from scratch, many of which are clones of already existing functions. This project is a good way to master the basics of C, while also beginning to learn some more complex concepts for beginners, such as linked lists.

Project completed on November 11 2023 with bonus (125/100).
